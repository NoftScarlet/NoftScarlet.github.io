                                            Grant had been hosting backyard barbecues every summer and if you lived any
                                            where close to him you would definitely receive an invitation.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            After a traumatic brain injury earlier that year you can imagine how excited
                                            he was to see his friends again. He now had impaired hand eye coordination
                                            but Grant was still set on flipping his neighbourhood famous burgers.
                                            You can imagine the horror on the neighbours faces when Grant suddenly
                                            dropped his spatula, clutched his arm, and fell violently to the floor.
                                            It was later discovered at the hospital that Grant had suffered from a
                                            stroke as a consequence of his earlier brain injury.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            If it wasn't for people like you, Grant would not have discovered the
                                            courage within himself to push through and stay positive.
                                            You know that every person is worth saving.
                                            Grant found people like you at the Vancouver Brain Injury Association.
                                            Through support groups, rehab programs, and compassionate volunteers, Grant
                                            was able to return to his normal life.
                                            Grant appreciates you for the strength you see within people, even when they
                                            can't see it in themselves.

                                            Emilia is someone who would give you a warm hug and a bright smile every
                                            time she saw you.
                                            Her 5th grade students knew her as Mrs. Robertson, and experiencing her
                                            warmth in the classroom is something you never forget.
                                            You would not have noticed that anything was wrong with Emilia, she seemed
                                            to be just fine. She would say "one day I woke up feeling strange", but
                                            quickly would brush it off and ask you about your day.<br/><br/>
                                            Imagine Emilia's concern when she started forgetting students names, daily
                                            tasks, her route to school.
                                            Day to day living became frustrating and stressful. You could see the light
                                            in Emilia's eyes begin to dim.
                                            Then her doctor discovered Emilia was living with a progressive brain
                                            disease. The doctor referred Emily to the Vancouver Brain Injury Association
                                            brain injury recovery program.<br/><br/>
                                            You know, Emilia soon responded to the friendship, therapies, and
                                            neurological exercise activities at Brain Gain Fridays. Symptoms decreased
                                            and the progress of Emilia's brain disease slowed.
                                            Because of people like you, Emilia got help, care, and a supportive
                                            community.
                                            People who care gave so Emilia could get her life back.

                                            You have probably met people who's lives revolve around the sport they play.
                                            Theresa was exactly that type of person. She would tell you with a winning
                                            smile that she "lived, breathed, and cried on the tennis court". She
                                            wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>
                                            You know university tuition is expensive nowadays. Theresa was counting on
                                            securing a tennis scholarship. Her sport wasn't just a hobby, it was a
                                            career.
                                            Imagine the pressure, the high stakes of every single tennis match, the
                                            commitment to give 110%. You feel your heart pumping, the sweat dripping
                                            down your face, the sun as it is beating down your back. Suddenly, you feel
                                            nothing.<br/><br/>
                                            Theresa woke up in the hospital to find out she had hit her head. She had a
                                            traumatic brain injury.
                                            Having your entire identity stolen from you in the blink of an eye makes
                                            recovery very traumatic.
                                            Theresa sunk into despair. If it wasn't for people like you, Theresa might
                                            not have recovered.<br/><br/>
                                            You support, you are compassionate, you reach out a hand and help those who
                                            have fallen down. You value community and coming together to make people
                                            strong.
                                            Theresa found people like you at the Vancouver Brain Injury Association.
                                            Through support groups, rehab programs, and new found friendships, she began
                                            to get back on her feet.
                                            Theresa thanks people like you for giving her the chance to become herself
                                            again, one serve at a time.

                                            shoulders? Max does.
                                            Max was just a high school student when he was attacked by an assailant and
                                            knocked to the ground. His head hit the ground hard, and while he did not
                                            know it yet, he had suffered a major concussion.<br/><br/>
                                            You can imagine the fear that Max felt when he could not tell the hospital
                                            where he lived.
                                            Doctors told Max he would recover soon. Then they said in a few months he
                                            would feel better. Then one doctor told Max not to expect to recover; Max
                                            might have to live with a brain injury forever.<br/><br/>
                                            You know that's not true – people can recover from brain injury.
                                            Fortunately, Max found the Vancouver Brain Injury Association.
                                            You know in this world, some things are just worth fighting for.
                                            People you might know, and other people like you, provided support groups

                Brain injury survivors often do not get the support that they need.
                In Vancouver, there are no shortage of brain injury survivors in need of aid, and each story is
                different. With the onset of COVID-19, these people need help now more than ever.
                You alone can make the difference.
                Please help people like Gerry. You can give survivors the support they need.
